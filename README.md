# ðŸš— Parking Space Counter

A smart system to detect and count parked cars and available parking spaces using computer vision and Python.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Description

This project aims to build an intelligent Parking Space Counter that detects how many cars are currently present in a parking lot and how many spots are still vacant. Using computer vision techniques (like OpenCV), the system processes camera footage to monitor parking activity in real-time.

The tool is designed to help organize parking spaces more efficiently and can be integrated with smart city systems or mobile apps to provide live updates to users.
